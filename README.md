Project for the course ECE243: Computer Organization. The code in this repository is a modified version with all data used being included in the main file so that it can be run on the simulator, as well as removed music assets for size limit: Try it for yourself on the Nios II simulator at https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=nios-de1soc, and make sure to disable the 'Memory: Suspicious use of cache bypass' check in the Debugging Checks menu. (Or if you have your own DE1-SoC, you can use that too!)
