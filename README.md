# mischievous-kitty

Made with https://github.com/shill7, project for the course ECE243: Computer Organization during the 2024 Winter semester. The code in this repository is a modified version with all data used being included in the main file so that it can be run on the simulator, as well as removed music assets for size limit: Try it for yourself on the Nios II simulator at https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=nios-de1soc, and make sure to disable the 'Memory: Suspicious use of cache bypass' check in the Debugging Checks menu. (Or if you have your own DE1-SoC, you can use that too!)

It depicts a game where you play as a cat and try to cause chaos without being caught, where you use the keyboard or DE1-SoC controls to hit the plant and try to destroy it without being spotted by your guardian. The plant will degrade with each hit, and after 10 hits, the round is won. The game is won after five rounds won. Uses different aspects of the FPGA, such as the hardware timer, VGA images, HEX display for the scoring, and I/O devices such as the keys and audio system to display various sound effects (as well as background music in the full version for each stage).

All visuals and audio were found as free assets from itch.io or opengameart.org
